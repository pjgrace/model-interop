/**
 * A state can be one of three types in the state machine:
 * - A start node (1 and only 1 in each machine - has only outgoing transitions)
 * - A normal node (general intermediary node between transition in the
 *   machine i.e. there is at least one incoming and and at least one outgoing
 *   transition)
 * - A trigger node which must have a single transition for sending a message
 * - An end node (at least one in each machine - has only incoming transitions)
 *
 * Rules: i) The start node can be a trigger or normal state.
 * ii) An end node must not be a trigger node
 * ii) A node cannot be both a normal and trigger node
 *
 * This is the interface to query information about one of these individual
 * states in a state machine.
